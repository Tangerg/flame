// Package exactjson states how this CLI decodes a JSON number that lands in an
// any. An operator-edited tool argument carries the identifiers Runtime decoded,
// which routinely sit past IEEE-754's exact range, and encoding/json/v2
// represents a number in an any as a float64 — rounding those silently and
// refusing magnitudes outside float64 entirely. The approved call would then
// execute with an argument the operator never reviewed.
//
// This is the remedy encoding/json/v2 documents for that case, not a local
// workaround: v2 says to supply an unmarshaler that pre-populates the interface
// with a concrete type that preserves precision. v1's decoder-wide UseNumber is
// the only part of the vocabulary v2 does not export, so it is the only part
// restated here.

// Numbers decodes every JSON number reaching an any as a [jsonv1.Number]
// holding the original literal. It changes nothing else: the unmarshaler
// declines other kinds before reading a token, which is how encoding/json/v2 is
// told to apply its own handling instead.
//
// [jsonv1.Number] is the standard library's exact-number carrier and
// encoding/json/v2 marshals and unmarshals it directly, so a value decoded this
// way re-encodes to the literal it came from.
