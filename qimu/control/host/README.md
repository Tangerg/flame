# Browser Host adapter

`qimu/control` is the single source of control DTOs and their TypeScript
projection. This package implements the authenticated Go driver and HTTP port.
It depends on the original Qimu Host and SQLite Store, which share one Admission.
It does not select providers or publish a second catalog.

The application creates the Host and Store, constructs `NewBridge`, and registers
the Bridge as the `browser-js` driver. `ModuleSource` projects an approved unit to
one immutable artifact. Opaque installation configuration is withheld by
default; `PublicConfiguration` must explicitly project data intended for the
browser. Optional `RemoteSource` adapters bind real Portable transports to exact
approved imports and register their resources with the original Setup.

Bootstrap callers create an operation ID and a random resume token before
calling `OpenRealm`. The operation-to-Realm mapping and only a credential
verifier are durable. A lost response can recover that original Realm without
creating another one. `ResumeRealm` after Host reconstruction grants cleanup
authority only. The trusted in-process `Credentials` projection lets application
composition reuse the original session without a second Realm registry; it is
not exposed through `Handler`.

`Handler` accepts authenticated POST requests containing `{method,input}` and
returns the published control DTO. The application owns TLS, origin policy and
bootstrap authentication. The bearer credential belongs to a Realm and must
never appear in plugin configuration, artifact URLs or logs.

`Poll` returns complete pending plans and fences. `Ready` observes preparation;
only the Core Host publishes exports. Point acquisition retains the original
multi-Point Snapshot and candidate provenance. Trusted consumers use
`AcquirePlan` for a fresh declaration plan created in the target Realm; its
candidate and setup premises remain subject to the Core's final admission.
`AcquireBinding` restores an already accepted exact export graph. Each path can
create a child Use under its original accepted parent, and persists original
Use approval before handing a grant to JavaScript.

Each wire Snapshot is a Realm-owned selection lease. `Acquire` takes it exactly
once when the operation is admitted, including an attempt whose selection later
fails. Repeating that operation ID observes its original grant or refusal; a new
selection needs a new Snapshot. `CloseSnapshot` discards a pending lease and is
idempotent after close or acquisition. It does not cancel an admitted acquisition
or release a Use. Close abandoned and read-only snapshots explicitly. Realm
sealing and cleanup-only reconnect discard all of that Realm's pending leases.
Concurrent Snapshot completion cannot insert a lease after sealing.

`SealRealm` revokes new work in one Realm without fencing other windows using the
same installation. An exposed plan remains protected until its original proof
arrives. A Use proof settles the original parent-to-child delegated closure,
including an unknown child acknowledgement. An execution proof settles only
that original execution's Uses. Proof acknowledgement waits for durable release;
repeating it never starts cleanup again or substitutes a new exit identity.
